Just put them in `scripts`, add the new scripts to the `hubot-scripts.json` file, \nrestart your robot, and you're good to go.\n\nAll the scripts in this repository are located in\n[`src/scripts`](https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/tree/master/src/scripts).\n\n## Writing\n\nWant to write your own Hubot script? The best way is to take a look at an\n[existing script](https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/tweet.coffee)\nand see how things are set up. Hubot scripts are written in CoffeeScript, a\nhigher-level implementation of JavaScript.\n\nYou'll also want to [add tests](https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/blob/master/test/tests.coffee)\nfor your script; no one likes untested code. It makes Hubot sad.\n\nAdditionally, it's extremely helpful to add [TomDoc](http://tomdoc.org) to the\ntop of each file. (Check out [an example](https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/speak.coffee#L1-5)).\nWe'll pull out the commands from those lines and display them in the generic,\nrobot-wide `hubot help` command.\n\n## Discovering\n\n[The Script Catalog](http://hubot-script-catalog.herokuapp.com/)\n\n","maintainers":[{"name":"atmos","email":"atmos@atmos.org"}],"_etag":"\"9J27WPY0BRVQK5RJCYIUI6HHI\""}
